This colorscheme was inspired by other low/medium contrast colorschemes. None of them had the kind of colours that were easy on my eyes.

I strove for a scheme that had a good contrast to make syntax highlighting help with establishing context as well as making sure the colours would not hurt your eyes over a longer period of time.
